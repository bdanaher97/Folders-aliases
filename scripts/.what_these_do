#### `/scripts` – WHAT THESE DO

- **generate-manifest.mjs**
  Scans gallery folders and generates `.folders` and `.images` helper files for each directory.

  **Reminder:** Run this before committing if you’ve added, removed, or renamed galleries/images — it keeps the helper files in sync.

- **build.js**
  Runs the Next.js build process with any project-specific pre-build steps (e.g., ensuring manifests are up to date before compiling).

- **dev.js**
  Starts the Next.js development server on the configured port (3001), allowing live reload while editing code and content.
